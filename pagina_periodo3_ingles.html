    <h1>Rules for Building Peace</h1>

    <!-- Rule 1 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #1: Treat Others the Way You Want to Be Treated</h2>
        <p>The old and good Golden Rule says it all: Empathy, tolerance, and peace. This principle teaches you to love yourself and love others. It transcended cultures and faiths and is a universal concept from ancient times that cannot fail!</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla1.jpeg" alt="Rule 1 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule was about treating others the way you wanted to be treated.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has emphasized treating others the way you want to be treated.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rule 2 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #2: Listen to Hear What Others Have to Say, Not Just to Speak</h2>
        <p>Engage in a dialogue with an open mind and a genuine willingness to listen to others. Only then can you understand each other and build bridges. Change cannot happen, and peace cannot be established if people cannot communicate with one another, listen to their experiences and viewpoints, and show empathy, understanding, and respect.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla2.jpeg" alt="Rule 2 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule encouraged listening to hear what others had to say, not just to speak.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has stressed listening to hear what others have to say, not just to speak.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rule 3 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #3: Accept Difference of Opinion</h2>
        <p>Everyone has different opinions, and not everyone may agree on the same things. Building compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly important. Sometimes we just have to agree to disagree and recognize that there are different beauties and forms of expression that are not our own.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla3.jpeg" alt="Rule 3 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule emphasized accepting differences of opinion.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has emphasized accepting differences of opinion.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rule 4 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #4: Do Not Fight Violence with Violence</h2>
        <p>Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be achieved through free will, dialogue, empathy, and forgiveness. Do not stoop to the same level as someone who is violent, and thus continue the vicious cycle.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla4.jpeg" alt="Rule 4 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule advised against fighting violence with violence.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has advised against fighting violence with violence.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rule 5 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #5: Accept That Identity Is Fluid</h2>
        <p>Anyone can have multiple aspects of their identity. Identity comprises many elements like nationality, cultural-linguistic origin, age, and religious beliefs. Identity can change and evolves, taking many new forms and means of personal expression as we learn new languages, move homes, adopt new beliefs, marry into a different tradition, and experience life! Do not put people in a box. Avoid categorizing people according to an "us versus them" narrative and remember; we are all unique individuals with unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly divisive and unproductive.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla5.jpeg" alt="Rule 5 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule emphasized that identity is fluid.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has emphasized that identity is fluid.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Rule 6 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #6: Avoid Stereotypes</h2>
        <p>Take people for who they are. Avoid misconceptions, stereotypes, and toxic narratives and get to know a person instead. This will lead to offenses, misunderstandings, and ultimately help you create a real bond with others based on true understanding, empathy, and trust. After all, no one likes to be judged, especially from the outside.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla6.jpeg" alt="Rule 6 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule emphasized avoiding stereotypes.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has emphasized avoiding stereotypes.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rule 7 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #7: Approach Media with Skepticism</h2>
        <p>Do not believe everything you see on television, in newspapers, or on the Internet. Think objectively for yourself. Get to know the people and facts behind any story and do not fall for media scapegoating. Stay united.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla7.jpeg" alt="Rule 7 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule emphasized approaching media with skepticism.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has emphasized approaching media with skepticism.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rule 8 -->
    <div class="rule">
        <h2>Rule #8: Be Careful with the Language You Use</h2>
        <p>Your choice of language, along with tone and intonation, conveys a message. Ensure that message is a positive one. Be aware of the language you use, avoiding anything that is misogynistic, racist, islamophobic, homophobic, or antisemitic. Do not underestimate the power of language - for better or worse! And remember, it's not just what you say, it's how you say it.</p>
        <img  class="img" src="src/regla8.jpeg" alt="Rule 8 Image">
        <p>Simple Past: The rule emphasized being careful with the language you use.</p>
        <p>Present Perfect: The rule has emphasized being careful with the language you use.</p>
